Certificate Transparency Log client suitable for monitoring, quick SCT validation, gossiping, etc.

## Build requirement

OpenSSL >= 1.1.0

## Features

* [Monitor tree head update and certificates](https://docs.rs/ctclient/0.4/ctclient/struct.CTClient.html)
* Verify consistency and inclusion proof (automatically or via [low level API](https://docs.rs/ctclient/0.4/ctclient/internal/index.html#functions))
* Verify Signed Tree Head (STH) and Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT), and [fetch and verify inclusion proof to defend the SCT](https://docs.rs/ctclient/0.4/ctclient/struct.CTClient.html#method.check_inclusion_proof_for_sct).
* More low level API to [mess with leaf data](https://docs.rs/ctclient/0.4/ctclient/internal/struct.Leaf.html#fields), [proof construction](https://docs.rs/ctclient/0.4/ctclient/internal/fn.consistency_proof_parts.html), etc.
* [Extract SCT from certificate](https://docs.rs/ctclient/0.4/ctclient/struct.SignedCertificateTimestamp.html#method.from_cert_sct_extension)
* Lots of comment in code intended as reference for other hackers.

## TODOs

* **Implement gossiping protocols**
* A helper to monitor multiple logs simultaneously
* Certificate submission
* More test coverage

## Examples & DEMOs

Note that you can run those by <code>cargo run --example <i>name</i></code>

* `examples/parse_sct_list_from_cert.rs`: Parse a certificate with a "CT Precertificate SCTs" extension and print out the SCTs. Also check that the logs can provide an inclusion proof for those leafs based on the latest tree head.

	![screenshot](readme_img/example_parse_sct_list_from_cert.png)

* `examples/live_stream_domains.rs`: Read out certificates as they are published by a log and print out the CA and domain names.

	DEMO at the top of this README.

* `examples/simple_client/simple_client.rs`: A simple SQLite-backed CT log client monitoring a single log.

	* Check that the tree is consistent (extend-only) each time a new tree head is received.
	* Download and inspect all certificates searching for a hard-coded domain name.
	* Store tree heads and matched certificates in SQLite database.
	* Intended to be a base on which more sophisticated clients can be built.
